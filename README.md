## 🧩 Hypothesis Framework

### Framework Used: **5C Framework**
- **Customer**
- **Company**
- **Competition**
- **Collaborators**
- **Context**

### Reason for Choosing:
The 5C Framework provides a MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) way to break down the factors influencing lead conversion — internal (company, collaborators) and external (customer, context, competition).

### 2. Company
- H4: Opportunities handled by new sales reps have lower win rates (P2)
- H5: Certain B2B Sales Mediums (e.g., email) have low engagement (P0)

### 3. Competition
- H6: Losses are higher in sectors with strong competitors (e.g., cloud security) (P3)

### 4. Collaborators
